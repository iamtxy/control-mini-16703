\textbf{Part B}

\textbf{(1) }

the complex conjugate eigen values $-0.5 \pm i$ indicate system will oscillate with a decaying amplitude. 

the 0 eigen values indicate the system is marginally stable.

There are two peaks in the magnitude plot at $2.2e-9$ and $1.05$ rad/s respectively. The peak at $2.2e-9$ rad/s is more dominant. 

The first high peak is cause by two spinning disk oscillating against each other as the control frequency gradually increase from DC. Because there are two 0 eigen values, this indicate that there are two integrator in the system, so the phase shifted by 180 degrees. 

Then as the frequency increases to 1.05 rad/s, which should be the resonant frequency. At this point the complex conjugate eigen values start to kick in, causing the phase to change further. 

Then the zero of the system at -10 causes the phase to shift back by 90 degrees.
